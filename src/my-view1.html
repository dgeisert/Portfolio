      <h2>About this portfolio</h2>

      <p>This my polymer based portfolio, source in GitHub.  It is purposefully limited in the images shown, as I am not a graphic designer.  I am a system and interaction designer and product manager.</p>

      <p>Here you will find a list of many of the projects I’ve worked on over the course of my career, with links where possible.</p>

      <h2>My Approach to Design</h2>

      <p>I have been designing and developing games for six years, five years of which were using the Unity platform.</p>

      <p>I focus mainly on using first principles of psychology and decision theory to determine the best designs for complex systems.  While this involves design, marketing, and development my primary focus is on product management.  I have released games on web, mobile, and computers, taking the products through every stage of development on each platform.  I have not yet released to console or VR, but am working towards that as a primary personal goal for 2017.</p>

      <p>I thrive in an environment of people who are always striving to be better at what they do.  I am passionate about learning and attempt to apply my learnings to my work, my work environment, and my personal life.</p>

      <h2>Other interesting things about me</h2>

      <p>I am an avid audiobook listener.  I have listened to and lead discussion groups on many books, mostly non-fiction business related.  I’ve managed three different book clubs, the longest and still running has been meeting monthly for over 2 years.  If you don’t already have a book club, I will start one.  We will almost certainly start with <i>Managing the Design Factory</i> by Donald G. Reinertsen.</p>

      <p>I enjoy painting, but am not terribly good at it.  I’ve done a half dozen Paint Nite events around the bay, and enjoy the creation and social aspects of it.</p>

      <p>I also love diving, especially in sunken ships and caves.</p>
