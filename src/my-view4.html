      <h1>Cat Duo</h1>
      <p>At Cat Duo I was Founder/CEO, sole developer, and sole designer.</p>
      <p>Cat Duo took on the challenge of making a strong local multiplayer experience without needing extra devices.  We were able to build out a proof of concept with a team of four: myself as developer/designer, an artist, a community manager, and a business development person.  We were able to get to the user testing stage before being unable to continue.</p>
