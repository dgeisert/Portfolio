      <h2>Niko Vuori - Proven Entrepreneurial Product & Operations Leader</h2>

      <p>I’ve had the pleasure of working with David twice now – most recently at Rocket Games, where David owned the entirety of the systems design/development function (as well as pitching in on marketing and user acquisition when called upon) and prior to that at Zynga, where David was a Product Manager on Frontierville, one of Zynga’s largest games at the time. David is whip-smart, combining a very keen analytical mind with an ability to understand the bigger picture and player needs. David is also highly technical, and able to develop his own tools in order to improve processes and minimize the risk of error. David is able to think on his feet, and tackle new challenges to which he has not previously been exposed with confidence – a great example of this occurred at Rocket Games, when the company suddenly found itself in a position to ramp up spending on user acquisition and marketing from nothing to a $1M+ budget each month. David worked with me and our Director of Analytics to build accurate LTV models, automate our user acquisition spend on Facebook and develop tools to monitor CPIs using Tableau. These efforts were critical in ensuring that user acquisition spend was profitable, and the company was able to scale. I would love to work with David again, and hope that our paths cross again in the future.</p>

      <h2>Brian Guenther - Sr. Director of Product</h2>

      <p>David is one of the most capable, disciplined, and methodical individuals I've worked with. He is extremely versatile, as he took on a variety of roles at Rocket to accommodate the needs of the company - from systems design to product management to user acquisition, he did it all and did it well. He is dedicated to continuous learning and growth as an individual, which has led him to excel as a contributor. He is willing and able to operate independently, executing on difficult or less-defined projects. I was always able to trust that once David had started a project that he'd see it through to completion. I'd happily work with David again in the future.</p>
