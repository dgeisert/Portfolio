      <h1>Rocket Games</h1>
      <p>I joined the company in early 2015, at which point they had released 10 apps.  The number of apps as of March 2017 was 56.  I have included only the ones in which I played a major role.  I at some point worked on all 46 apps that were released since joining, as well as working on updates to most of the 10 apps that were already released by Rocket when I joined the company.  Rocket Speed has been able to move so quickly by creating core technology that can be reused across multiple apps.</p>
      <p>Rocket Speed was 17 people when I joined, and grew to 35 people when acquired by Penn National in 2016 for up to $170M.</p>
      <p>All games I worked on at Rocket Speed were made with Unity.</p>
